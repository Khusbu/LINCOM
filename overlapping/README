/** This package finds out overlapping clusters and its overlapping modularity for different INS values (0.4 to 0.85 interval of 0.05) **/

Commands:

make                               #builds the Louvain code for your architecture
./script_overlap.sh <filename>     #runs iterations on LINCOM_disjoint for different INS values.

Output (Console) :
===================
$ ./script_overlap.sh sample_graph.txt
